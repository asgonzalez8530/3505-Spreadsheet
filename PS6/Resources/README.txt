Initial Design Ideas: We will need three text boxes. Two of the text boxes will be non-editable (cell name and value). 
One of the text boxes will be editable (contents). All three text boxes make up the cell properties. There will be a menu that 
offers the options to save, open, close, or begin a new spreadsheet. The open and close features will check to see if there are 
any unsaved changes. If yes, then the GUI will prompt the user to save before moving onto the next action. We will design the 
GUI so that the menu is on top, then the cell properties, then the spreadsheet panel. All three containers will resize accordingly 
when the GUI panel changes sizes.

PS4 Version: 1.0

Notes for the TAs: Our project was setup in an the proper MVC format. We used the proper abstraction so that the different classes
could speak to each other and work together to create a fuctional spreadsheet GUI.
