            An AbstractSpreadsheet object represents the state of a simple spreadsheet.  A 
            spreadsheet consists of an infinite number of named cells.
            
            A string is a cell name if and only if it consists of one or more letters,
            followed by one or more digits AND it satisfies the predicate IsValid.
            For example, "A15", "a15", "XY032", and "BC7" are cell names so long as they
            satisfy IsValid.  On the other hand, "Z", "X_", and "hello" are not cell names,
            regardless of IsValid.
            
            Any valid incoming cell name, whether passed as a parameter or embedded in a formula,
            must be normalized with the Normalize method before it is used by or saved in 
            this spreadsheet.  For example, if Normalize is s => s.ToUpper(), then
            the Formula "x3+a5" should be converted to "X3+A5" before use.
            
            A spreadsheet contains a cell corresponding to every possible cell name.  
            In addition to a name, each cell has a contents and a value.  The distinction is
            important.
            
            The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
            contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.  (By analogy, the contents
            of a cell in Excel is what is displayed on the editing line when the cell is selected.)
            
            In a new spreadsheet, the contents of every cell is the empty string.
             
            The value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.  
            (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
            in the grid.)
            
            If a cell's contents is a string, its value is that string.
            
            If a cell's contents is a double, its value is that double.
            
            If a cell's contents is a Formula, its value is either a double or a FormulaError,
            as reported by the Evaluate method of the Formula class.  The value of a Formula,
            of course, can depend on the values of variables.  The value of a variable is the 
            value of the spreadsheet cell it names (if that cell's value is a double) or 
            is undefined (otherwise).
            
            Spreadsheets are never allowed to contain a combination of Formulas that establish
            a circular dependency.  A circular dependency exists when a cell depends on itself.
            For example, suppose that A1 contains B1*2, B1 contains C1*2, and C1 contains A1*2.
            A1 depends on B1, which depends on C1, which depends on A1.  That's a circular
            dependency.

            <summary>
            Class representation of a spreadsheet cell. Each cell has a contents and a value. 
            
            The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
            contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.
            
            The value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.  
            (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
            in the grid.)
            
            If a cell's contents is a string, its value is that string.
            
            If a cell's contents is a double, its value is that double.
            
            If a cell's contents is a Formula, its value is either a double or a FormulaError,
            as reported by the Evaluate method of the Formula class.  The value of a Formula,
            of course, can depend on the values of variables.  The value of a variable is the 
            value of the spreadsheet cell it names (if that cell's value is a double) or 
            is undefined (otherwise).
            
            Cells are contents are immutable. In order to change the contents of a cell, a new 
            cell must be created.
